      <h2 id="about">about me</h2>
      <p class="introtext">hi! i am andrew lin, a third-year undergraduate student at the <i>university of chicago</i>. i major in <i>sociology</i> and <i>media arts and design</i>, and i am very passionate about games and play. i seek to both examine them as cultural objects, and try to incorporate my own reflections of sociology into my design process.</p>
      <p class="introtext">i have mostly worked on team projects and i really value coordination and communication in the game design process. i am also eager to apply my academic learnings, especially my study of the sociology of culture, in real-world contexts.</p>
      <p class="introtext">please feel free to browse through my portfolio to see my projects and the skills i could bring to the table!</p>
